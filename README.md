Support teams lose time and increase customer risk when urgent tickets, SLA threats, internal knowledge, and engineering escalations are handled manually.

This control tower uses a LangGraph agent workflow to triage tickets, retrieve cited KB context, draft customer/engineering responses, and pause every risky action for human approval.

# Support Escalation Agent Control Tower

`support-escalation-agent-control-tower` / `agent-escalation-tower` is a local-first portfolio implementation of an AI-assisted support escalation control tower. It helps support teams ingest tickets, classify intent, detect SLA risk, retrieve internal KB context, draft customer and engineering responses, pause for human approval, and preserve trace/audit/metrics evidence for every run.

The default mode uses deterministic local/mock providers, so a fresh clone runs without paid LLM keys. Optional OpenAI and Azure OpenAI adapters are available behind the provider interface, with local fallback and human-approval boundaries preserved.

## What Is Included

## Scope Guardrails

This project intentionally stays focused on escalation operations:

- triage and classification
- SLA risk detection
- internal KB retrieval
- draft customer replies
- draft engineering escalations
- human approval before dispatch
- trace, audit, and performance monitoring

It does not become a full helpdesk SaaS, CRM, or customer chat widget.
