Support teams lose time and increase customer risk when urgent tickets, SLA threats, internal knowledge, and engineering escalations are handled manually.

This control tower uses a LangGraph agent workflow to triage tickets, retrieve cited KB context, draft customer/engineering responses, and pause every risky action for human approval.

# Support Escalation Agent Control Tower

`support-escalation-agent-control-tower` / `agent-escalation-tower` is a local-first portfolio implementation of an AI-assisted support escalation control tower. It helps support teams ingest tickets, classify intent, detect SLA risk, retrieve internal KB context, draft customer and engineering responses, pause for human approval, and preserve trace/audit/metrics evidence for every run.

The default mode uses deterministic local/mock providers, so a fresh clone runs without paid LLM keys. OpenAI or Azure OpenAI can be wired later behind the included provider interface without changing workflow code.

## What Is Included

- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic, pydantic-settings, async services
- LangGraph workflow orchestration with a documented sequential fallback if LangGraph cannot import

- SQLite-backed durable state for tickets, runs, traces, approvals, audit events, and metrics
- Fake Zendesk, Jira, Slack, and internal KB adapters
- Persistent local integration outbox for approved fake customer replies, Zendesk updates, Jira issues, engineering escalations, and Slack alerts

## Scope Guardrails

This project intentionally stays focused on escalation operations:

- triage and classification
- SLA risk detection
- internal KB retrieval
- draft customer replies
- draft engineering escalations
- human approval before dispatch
- trace, audit, and performance monitoring

It does not become a full helpdesk SaaS, CRM, or customer chat widget.

## Configuration

See `.env.example`.

Important variables:

- `CONTROL_TOWER_API_KEYS`: comma-separated accepted API keys
- `CONTROL_TOWER_DEMO_API_KEY`: key returned by demo token endpoint
- `CONTROL_TOWER_STATE_FILE`: SQLite persistence path
- `CONTROL_TOWER_MAX_TOOL_ATTEMPTS`: KB/tool retry limit
- `CONTROL_TOWER_LOW_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: confidence threshold for review
- `CONTROL_TOWER_SLA_HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD`: escalation threshold
- `CONTROL_TOWER_LLM_PROVIDER`: local/mock default, with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI treated as optional production activation paths

## Reliability Surfaces

- `GET /integrations/outbox`: persistent local event log for approved fake dispatches.
- `GET /integrations/outbox/{outbox_id}`: one dispatch payload and destination.
- `POST /drills/tool-failure`: local production-readiness drill with KB retry failures, trace timeline, and pending human approval.
- `POST /drills/sla-breach-simulation`: deterministic manager queue of breached, critical, warning, and watch tickets.
